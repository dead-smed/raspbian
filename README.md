My Raspbian Scripts

Shell scripts I often use on raspbian installs.

clean-down4.sh  #clears packages from standard raspbian to make a smaller simpler footprint.
cpu-test.sh     #stress tests CPU.
temp.sh         #returns the temperature of the BCM2835 SoC.
update.sh       #checks for updates and asks if you want to install them.
